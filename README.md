# 🚀 Docker Hands-On Labs Repository

### **By . Sandeep Kumar Sharma**

Welcome to the **most comprehensive, trainer-style Docker learning repository** available on GitHub. This repository contains **beginner to advanced hands-on labs**, **production-grade scenarios**, and **high-quality study materials**, including PDFs, books, PPTs, and reference guides.

This repo is structured exactly like a **live corporate training program**, making it perfect for learners, trainers, and working professionals.

---

## 📘 What This Repository Offers

### **1️⃣ Beginner to Intermediate Docker Labs**

A clean, structured set of labs that take you from basics to real-world usage:

* Basic Docker Commands
* Building Custom Docker Images
* Port Mapping Labs
* Volumes & Bind Mounts
* Named Volumes
* Docker Compose (Beginner to Advanced)
* Docker Networking (Bridge, Host, Dev Networks)

These labs prepare you with strong foundational container skills.

---

### **2️⃣ Advanced, Production-Ready Docker Labs** *(Inside `Docker-advanced-lab/`)*

These are deep-dive labs based on real-world DevOps & SRE scenarios:

* Multi-Stage Docker Builds
* Docker Runtime Security with Falco
* Advanced Image Caching & BuildKit
* Overlay Filesystem & Docker Storage Internals
* Macvlan & IPvlan Networking
* Service Mesh Concepts in Docker
* Docker CIS Benchmarking & Security Hardening
* Secrets Management Using Docker Swarm

These labs help you understand how Docker works **behind the scenes** and how it's secured in enterprise setups.

---

## 📚 Study Materials Included

This repository also provides premium-quality study materials:

* **Docker Books** – Docker Cookbook, Up & Running, In Practice, Extending Docker
* **DevOps PDFs** – DevOps basics & cloud-related references
* **Linux Notes**
* **Jenkins PPT**
* **Shell Script Mini-Projects**
* **AWS Cloud Lab PDFs**

This makes the repository a complete **self-learning library** for Docker & DevOps.

* Covers the full Docker journey — Beginner → Advanced → Production
* Includes **both labs + study materials**, which is rare in public GitHub repos
